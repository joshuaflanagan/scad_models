## Various OpenSCAD models

These is a collection of all of my [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) work.
A lot of it probably isn't of much interest to anyone else.
I plan to publish the more useful models to [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/joshuaf/about).

### Published models

- [lightsaber clip](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1289564) - My first try at
a customizer. It works well enough.
- [large phone stand](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1289600) - My first attempt
at a horizontal phone stand. It is way too big.

### Others

- dva_power_button.scad - replace the power button on a Rosewill Dual Fans case with a D.Va logo (from the game Overwatch)
